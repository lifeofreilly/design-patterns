===============

Java design patterns from Head First Design Patterns (2004 edition)


## /adapter

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of icompatible interfaces.

## /command

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
