===============

Java design patterns from Head First Design Patterns (2004 edition)


## /adapter

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## /command

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## /iterator
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underling representation.

## /templatemethod

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
