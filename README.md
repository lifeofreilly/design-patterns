===============
Java design patterns from Head First Design Patterns (2004 edition)

## /adapter
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## /command

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## /composite
The composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly.

## /decorator
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 

## /factory
The Factory Menthod Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## /factoryidiom
The Simple Factory isn't actually a Design Pattern; it's more of a programming idiom.

## /iterator
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underling representation.

## /nativeobserver
The Weather Station from /observer reworked to use java.util.Observable

## /observer
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notiied and updated automatically.

## /singleton
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point to access it.

##/state
The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## /strategy
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithims, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithims vary independently from clients that use it.

## /templatemethod
The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
